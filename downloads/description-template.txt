***** Availability of other formats *****
The fonds includes a number of media items that have been digitized (XX videotapes and XX audiocassettes). The analog originals have been retained, but the Archives will typically provide access only to the digital surrogates.

With born-digital records, the Archives' practice is to retain the materials in their original file formats and create normalized copies in designated access and preservation formats. Decisions on individual formats are codified in the Archives' Format Policy Registry (FPR). Typically the Archives will provide access via the designated access format, but it can provide copies in the original or preservation formats on request.

Digitized and born-digital materials may or may not be directly available from the associated description in SFU AtoM, depending on access or copyright restrictions. Materials not directly available online may be delivered by off-line methods. Consult the reference archivist for more information about access to offline digital materials.
