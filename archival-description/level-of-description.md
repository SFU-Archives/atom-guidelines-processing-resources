###### [SFU AtoM Guidelines](../README.md) `>` [Archival description](overview.md) `>` [Title and statement of responsibility area](overview.md#title-area)

# Level of description
| Fonds 	| Series 	| Files 	| Items 	|
|:-----:	|:------:	|:-----:	|:-----:	|
|   MA    |   MA    |   MA  	|   MA  	|

**Mandatory** at all levels.

There is no RAD rule for this element.

Terms are controlled by AtoM's `Levels of description` taxonomy:
- Fonds
- Sous-fonds
- Collection
- Series
- Sub-series
- Sub-sub-series
- Item

`Sous-fonds` is used by Special Collections, but not Archives.
- If the Archives were to start using this term, it would impact our reference code numbering conventions (see [Identifier](identifier.md)).
- If we get a use case for sous-fonds, we will review this decision at that review.

The Archives is still grappling with how to handle "sub-item" level, i.e. parts of an item.
- For now, continue to use `Item` as the level of description for sub-items.
