# Identifier

| Fonds 	| Series 	| Files 	| Items 	|
|:-----:	|:------:	|:-----:	|:-----:	|
|   MA    |   MA    |   IA  	|   IA  	|

There is no RAD rule for this element.

The Archives' numbering system always include an "F-" prefix, with placeholders for fonds, series, sub-series, sub-sub-series, file, and item numbers (as required).
- At file and item level, always include placeholders for parent series levels (series, sub-series, and sub-sub-series) even if these are empty.
- Example: `F-255-3-0-0-1` = file 1 of series 3 of fonds 255.

Do not use the `Generate identifier` link in AtoM to automatically assign the reference code.
- AtoM auto-generated identifiers use a date-based numbering scheme that does not follow the Archives' system.

At aggregate levels (fonds, series) obligation is **mandatory**.

At the file level, obligation is **required if applicable**.
- It should only be omitted in exceptional circumstances where the creator's original code is used in place of the Archives' normal reference code.
- For example, photographic materials in three fonds (see series [F-17-1](https://atom.archives.sfu.ca/f-17-1), [F-18-1](https://atom.archives.sfu.ca/f-18-1), [F-61-1](https://atom.archives.sfu.ca/f-16-1)) will eventually use the creator's numbering scheme as the `Identifier` at the file level (= one contact sheet) in order to simplify digitization and upload to AtoM, as well as reference requests.

Obligation is **optional** at the item level:
- When creating records manually or via csv import, include the `Identifier`.
- When item records are created via Archivematica DIP upload, they will not automatically be assigned identifiers; it is not required to manually assign identifiers following DIP upload.

Assess DIP upload scenarios on a case-by-case basis:
- Do not add identifiers when this will be too time-consuming.
