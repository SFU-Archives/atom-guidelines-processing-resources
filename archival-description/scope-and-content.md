| Fonds 	| Series 	| Files 	| Items 	|

This element is **mandatory** at the **fonds** and **series** level.
- Past practices sometimes omitted it as sub- and sub-sub-series levels, but you should include it at all series levels.

The element is optional at the **file** and **item** levels.
- The Archives does not typically include it at these lower levels.
- Use case for inclusion: description of non-textual items (e.g. films).

Following RAD, include the following elements:

**Highest level:** Functions / activities; Period of time; Subject matter; Geographical area; Arrangement, organization; May enumerate next lowest level; Documentary forms.

**Series:** Activities; Period of time; Subject matter; Geographical area; Documentary procedures; Kinds of information (if uniform); Arrangement; Classification scheme; Documentary forms

**File:** Subject matter; Time period; Geographical area; Procedures generating the file; Transactions; Arrangement; Documentary forms and their relationship.

**Item**: Subject matter and form; Data; Time period; Geographical area.

**Template text:**
`LEVEL consists of records relating to FUNCTIONS`

`Activities and topics documented include ACTIVITIES`

`Records include DOCUMENTARY_FORMS`

`File formats include FORMATS`

`Files arranged chronologically.`

Include information relating to arrangement unless you need to comment at length on arrangement issues (then use the [Arrangement](arrangement.md) note field).

At the end of the narrative include a list of child series to give an overview of arrangement.
- E.g. at fonds level, list series (but not sub- or sub-sub-series); at series level, list sub-series.

```
Fonds is arranged into the NN series:
* Series F-x-x, TITLE (dates)
* Series F-x-x, TITLE (dates)
```
