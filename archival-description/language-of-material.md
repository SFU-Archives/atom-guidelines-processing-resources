**Mandatory** at the `fonds` and `series` levels. **Required** at `file` and `item` levels if aiming at a `full description` (but not full descriptions are not typical or expected at those levels).
- Select all applicable languages from the drop-down list.
- Include `English` even though this applies to most our of holdings.

Rationale:
- This information will be included in our descriptions that may be eventually exported to multi-language union list databases.

`Files` and `items` uploaded from Archivematica will not have this field entered.
- It is not necessary to manually enter after the fact.

If the materials includes non-English languages, use [Language and script notes](language-and-script-notes.md) to elaborate (e.g. indicate where the materials are located if not obvious).
