# Access points
Apply **access points** to link descriptions to other AtoM entities: subjects, places, names.

## Subject access points

| Fonds 	| Series 	| Files 	| Items 	|
|:-----:	|:------:	|:-----:	|:-----:	|
|   MA    |   DN    |   DN  	|   DN  	|

Apply only at the **fonds** level. You should create at least one subject access point using a term drawn from the top-level terms of the [BC Thesaurus](xx).
- Terms are controlled by AtoM's `Subjects > BC Thesaurus` taxonomy.

Both Archives and Special Collections may develop their own custom subject taxonomies, but these have not yet been fully worked out.

## Place access points

| Fonds 	| Series 	| Files 	| Items 	|
|:-----:	|:------:	|:-----:	|:-----:	|
|   IA    |   IA    |  IA  	|   IA  	|

Apply **if applicable** at the most appropriate level(s).

Use to indicate the geographic location in which the records were generated or to which they otherwise relate.
- **Only use if outside the Lower Mainland.**
- Terms are controlled by AtoM's `Places` taxonomy.

## Genre access points

| Fonds 	| Series 	| Files 	| Items 	|
|:-----:	|:------:	|:-----:	|:-----:	|
|   OP    |   OP    |   OP  	|   OP  	|

**Optional** at all levels. Use to indicate the existence of record genres in the unit of description.
- Terms are controlled by AtoM's `Genres` taxonomy.

## Name access points

| Fonds 	| Series 	| Files 	| Items 	|
|:-----:	|:------:	|:-----:	|:-----:	|
|   IA    |   IA    |   IA  	|   IA  	|

Apply **if applicable** at the most appropriate level(s).

AtoM will automatically create a name access point for the entity registered as the [Creator](dates-of-creation-area.md#actor-name).

Create additional access points to indicate the existence of records in the unit that relate to other persons, organizations or families â€“ e.g. **correspondents** or **record subjects**.

See RAD 21.0B: "All access points must be apparent from the archival description to which they relate."
- E.g. the name should appear in file title or in series description.
- Alternatively, use phrasing in the [Scope and content](scope-and-content.md) such as "For the list of correspondents, see Access Points."
