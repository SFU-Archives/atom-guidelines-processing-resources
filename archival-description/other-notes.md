This usage began in 2021, replacing previous, more cumbersome practice of using the AtoM [Rights area](rights-area.md) to document reviews.

**Template text / examples:**

`File reviewed for access: MMM DD, YYYY (initials). File includes records containing the personal information of identifiable individuals (employment history). File restricted in whole.`

`File reviewed for access: MMM DD, YYYY (initials). File includes records containing the personal information of identifiable individuals (TYPE_PI). Restricted documents enclosed; the rest of the file is open.`

`File reviewed for access: MMM DD, YYYY (initials). No restricted information identified.`
