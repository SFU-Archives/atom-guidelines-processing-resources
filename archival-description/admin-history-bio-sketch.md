# Administrative history / Biographical sketch [RAD 1.7B]
| Fonds 	| Series 	| Files 	| Items 	|

This element resides within the creator's [Authority record](../authority-records/overview.md):
- It will only appear in description record if a [date event](dates-of-creation-area.md) (`Event type` = "Creation") has been registered with an `Actor` designated as the creator.

**Mandatory** for **fonds**, but note that for **collections**,  the collector's history will **not** appear with descriptive record.
- Collection is registered as a [date event](dates-of-creation-area.md), `Event type` = "Collection".

At lower levels, element is **optional** if a creator is different than the registered fonds creator.
- E.g. it is worth recording that a specific committee is the creator, but you do not have to write an admin history of the committee (though you can if you have time).

In both [Administrative histories](#administrative-history) and [Biographical sketches](#biographical-sketch), you should start the narrative description with a succinct summary (a paragraph of one or two sentences).
- Allows researchers to get quick overview and decide whether to continue with detailed description.
