###### [SFU AtoM Guidelines](../README.md) `>` [Archival description](overview.md) `>` [Administration area](overview.md#administration-area)

# Administration area
The `Administration area` appears only in AtoM `edit mode` and gives the user the option to change the record's [Display standard](#display-standard). Clicking the `More` button at the bottom of the description record gives access to the [Publication status](#publication-status) setting.

## Display standard
| Fonds 	| Series 	| Files 	| Items 	|
|:-----:	|:------:	|:-----:	|:-----:	|
|   DN    |   DN    |   DN  	|   DN  	|

The `Display standard` setting allows the user to change the metadata standard by which information is displayed / entered.
- E.g. you could switch between from the default `RAD` template to the `ISAD(G)` for just specific records.

The Archives' current practice is not to use this feature. Use cases are conceivable (espeically at the `item` level), but until we have one we will continue to use the `RAD` template throughout the application for SFU Archives' descriptions.

## Publication status
| Fonds 	| Series 	| Files 	| Items 	|
|:-----:	|:------:	|:-----:	|:-----:	|
|   MA    |   MA    |   MA  	|   MA  	|

All descriptions in AtoM have the default `Publication status` = "draft" until the user explicitly changes this to "published".
- `Draft` descriptions will not appear to the public (users not logged in).
- Publish descriptions by changing the status to "published"; they will be visible to public users.
- Unpublish descriptions by changing status back to "draft"; they will no longer be visible.

To change status:
- Click the `More` button at the bottom of the records and in the pop-up menu select `Update publication status`.
- Select the appropriate designation from the drop-down list.
- To apply the same status to all child records, check the `Update descendents` box.
