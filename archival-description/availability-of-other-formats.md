The main use cases relate to units for which the Archives has made **access** or **preservation** copies of the originals (analog or born-especially), especially where the copies are in digital form.

Use this field to discuss digitization specifications and / or access and preservation formats of born-digital materials. More generally, use to discuss issues relating to digital file formats included in the fonds / series.

Use in addition the [Restrictions on access](restrictions-on-access.md) field if the originals cannot be accessed, only the access copies.

**Template text / examples**

`The fonds includes a number of media items that have been digitized (XX videotapes and XX audiocassettes). The analog originals have been retained, but the Archives will typically provide access only to the digital surrogates.`

`With born-digital records, the Archives' practice is to retain the materials in their original file formats and create normalized copies in designated access and preservation formats. Decisions on individual formats are codified in the Archives' Format Policy Registry (FPR). Typically the Archives will provide access via the designated access format, but it can provide copies in the original or preservation formats on request.`

`Digitized and born-digital materials may or may not be directly available from the associated description in SFU AtoM, depending on access or copyright restrictions. Materials not directly available online may be delivered by off-line methods. Consult the reference archivist for more information about access to offline digital materials.`

`The Archives is in the process (as of DATE) of digitizing its film and video holdings. Some of the items in this series may have been digitized but not yet fully processed (ingested to the digital preservation system with preservation and access copies generated). Consult the reference archivist for more information.`

```
Files are available in their original file formats. Some older Microsoft formats (doc, xls) may not open in the current versions of those softwares. During processing, the archivist used a script to batch-convert all files to create a set of pdf access copies and these are available alongside the originals. Researchers should be aware that not all file formats could convert to pdf by this method; and in some cases (e.g. Excel) conversion to pdf may result in loss or significant distortion of original document formatting and functionality. Consult the reference archivist for more information.
