**Required if applicable** at the `fonds` and `series` levels; **optional** at lower levels.

Use to indicate the existence of related materials in other descriptive units for materials held at SFU (by Archives or Special Collections).

AtoM structures this field as a drop-down list of all descriptions in the system (from Archives or Special Collections)
- This automates the establishment of linkages, but there is no provision for a narrative note explaining the relationship.
- If you need to provide a narrative to explain relationships, use the [Associated materials](associated-materials.md) field in addition to selecting the related unit.
