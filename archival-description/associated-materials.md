**Optional** at all levels.

Use to indicate the existence of related materials held at other institutions.

Because of limitations to AtoM's [Related materials](related-materials.md) fields (offers links only, no place for text), you can also use the **Associated materials** field for narrative information about related materials in other fonds held by the Archives.

In the case of materials held at Special Collections, you can also use a [Name access point](access-points.md) and a link in the [Related materials](related-materials.md) field to further link the Archives' description with the associated descriptions of Special Collections.
