# Edition Area
In RAD, the **Edition area** is only for **item-level** description, used to "record statements relating to versions of items existing in two or more versions or states in single or multiple copies" (RAD 1.2A1). The Archives does not use these fields.

## Edition statement [RAD 1.2B]
| Fonds 	| Series 	| Files 	| Items 	|
|:-----:	|:------:	|:-----:	|:-----:	|
|   NA    |   NA    |   NA  	|   NR  	|

Do not use this field.

Use the [Availability of other formats](availability-of-other-formats.md) note field to discuss relationships between multiple versions (e.g. original, access, preservation copies).

Rationale:
- RAD only allows **Edition statements** at the item-level, but we may want to discuss relationships between copies at aggregate levels, e.g. if all items in a series have been digitized.

## Statement of responsibility relating to the edition [RAD 1.2B]
| Fonds 	| Series 	| Files 	| Items 	|
|:-----:	|:------:	|:-----:	|:-----:	|
|   NA    |   NA    |   NA  	|   NR  	|

Do not use this field.

The Archives uses [Date events](dates-of-creation-area.md) to capture statements of responsibility, linking an `Actor` to a `Description` using `Event type` field to characterize the relationship of responsibility.
