# Physical storage
| Fonds 	| Series 	| Files 	| Items 	|
|:-----:	|:------:	|:-----:	|:-----:	|
|   DN    |   DN    |   MA  	|   IA  	|

All `files` must be linked to a `Physical storage` record.
- If an `item` is part of a `file`, it does not need its own entry.
- If an `item` is a standalone entity, it must have its own entry.
- Do create storage entries at the `fonds` and `series` levels.

To create a `Physical storage` record, click the `More` button at the bottom of the description and in the pop-up menu select `Link physical storage`. The data entry screen has four fields.

`Containers`
- Use if linking to an existing container.
- Enter the container number in the form `fondsNumber-containerNumber` (e.g. "260-1").
- Leave blank if creating a new container.

`Name`
- Use to create a new container.
- Enter the container number in the form `fondsNumber-containerNumber` (e.g. "260-25").
- For materials that are stored direct to shelf without a container, use `MC` (map cabinet), `Oversize` (oversize area), or `SMI room`.

`Location`
- Enter "Archives stacks".

`Type`
- Select from the drop-down list of controlled terms.

**The Archives does not include specific location information.**
- The AIS database has its own `Repository` module that manages the storage locations of boxes and items stored directly to shelf.
- The scope of the AIS is larger than AtoM because it includes `backlog` boxes as well as `semi-active` records stored in the University Records Centre.
- We do not want to maintain (and need to be update) the same information in two systems.

To retrieve materials requested by researchers, use the `container number` or the file / item `reference code` to find its location in the AIS.
