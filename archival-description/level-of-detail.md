Not a RAD element.

**Required** at `fonds` and `series` levels, **optional** at lower levels.

Use to indicate degree of completeness of the description.

Use controlled terms from AtoM's `Description Detail Levels` taxonomy:
- `Full`
- `Partial`
- `Minimal`

A `partial description` includes all `mandatory` elements from the core set, broadly the same for all levels of description.
- This is typically sufficient for `file` and `item` descriptions, which are more lists than descriptions.

A `full description` includes in addition all the `required` and `required if applicable` elements, as well as any `optional` elements for a given level of description.
- The Archives typically aims for full description at the `fonds` and `series` levels.
- Only in exceptional circumstances should you attempt a full `file` or `item` description.

A `minimal` description is anything less than a `partial` description, i.e. fails to include the core mandatory elements.
