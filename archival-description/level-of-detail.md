Not a RAD element.

**Required** at **fonds** and **series** levels, **optional** at lower levels.

Use to indicate (select) whether the description is full, partial, or minimal.

A **partial description** includes all **mandatory** elements from a core set, broadly the same for all levels of description.
- This is typically sufficient for **file** and **item** descriptions (more lists than descriptions).

A **full description** includes in addition all the **required** and **required if applicable** elements, as well as any **optional** elements for a given level of description.
- The Archives typically aims for full description at the **fonds** and **series** levels.
- Only in exceptional circumstances should you attempt full **file** or **item** descriptions.

A **minimal** description is anything less than a **partial** description, i.e. fails to include the core mandatory elements.

The **obligation status** of elements can differ at different levels of description; see the [Overview page](overview.md) or download the [Archival Description Checklist: Obligation Status by Level of Description (pdf)](..downloads/obligation-status-by-level.pdf).
