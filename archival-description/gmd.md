# General Material Designation (GMD) [RAD 1.1C]
| Fonds 	| Series 	| Files 	| Items 	|
|:-----:	|:------:	|:-----:	|:-----:	|
|   MA    |   MA    |   RE  	|   RE  	|

**Required** at all levels for `full description` (but `full description` is not expected or typical at the `file` and `item` levels).
- You should must at least one GMD at the `fonds` and `series` levels.
- `Files` and `items` created by Archivematica DIP-upload or AtoM csv import will not automatically get `GMD` values on import; it is **not** necessary to manually add values.

Terms are managed by AtoM's `Material type taxonomy`. This list is customizable and we generally follow RAD's prescribed terms in plural form:
- Architectural drawings
- Cartographic materials
- Graphic materials
- Microforms
- Moving images
- Objects
- Philatelic records
- Photographic materials
- Records in electronic form (born-digital)
- Records in electronic form (digitized)
- Sound recordings
- Technical drawings
- Textual records

`Photographic materials`
- Not a RAD term (RAD subsumes photographs under **Graphic material**).
- Rationale for adding: we want to able filter searches by this facet as photos are frequently requested.

`Records in electronic form (born-digital)`
- Not a RAD term.
- Use to differentiates digital originals (born-digital) from digital copies of analog originals.

`Records in electronic form (digitized)`
- Use to indicate that digitized copies of analog originals exist.
- Note that there may be access restrictions on digitized copies so that they are not directly accessible from SFU AtoM.
- Use the [Availability of other formats](availability-of-other-formats.md) note field (at the most appropriate level) for information about the digitization process.

`Microforms`
- Use if the materials are available in microform (even if originals are also available in analog form).

Use the [Physical description note](physical-description-note.md) to indicate where (in which series or files) non-textual records are located, if this is not obvious from series titles.
- This is especially useful where there are only a small number of non-textual media items (e.g. sound recordings or videos); it saves the user having to guess or hunt about for these materials.
