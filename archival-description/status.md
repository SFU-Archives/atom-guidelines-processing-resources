Not a RAD element.

**Required** at `fonds` and `series` levels, **optional** at lower levels.

Select from the list of controlled terms (AtoM `Status` taxonomy):
- `Provisional` = draft or known to be incomplete
- `Final` = first finalized iteration
- `Revised` = revision of previously finalized version.

It is fine to publish a description (via the [Publication status](publication-status.md) field in the `Administration area`) that is still in draft form.
- E.g. you want to make the description available, but are not able to fully describe material.

**Optional** at the `file` and `item` levels.
- When created from Archivematica via DIP upload, this field will be blank; it is not necessary to manually update the records.
