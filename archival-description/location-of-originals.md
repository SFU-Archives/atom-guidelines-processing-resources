# Location of originals [RAD 1.8B15a]
| Fonds 	| Series 	| Files 	| Items 	|
|:-----:	|:------:	|:-----:	|:-----:	|
|   OP    |   OP    |   OP  	|   OP  	|

**Optional** at all levels.

The main use case is where a unit contains copies, the originals of which are located in another fonds held by the Archives or located in another repository.

Alternatively, you can use [Associated materials](associated-materials.md) (for originals located in another institution) and [Related materials](related-materials.md) (for originals located in another fonds at the Archives).
- These fields are preferred especially where the overlap between originals and copies is speculative or incomplete or inexact ("may be copies of", "includes copies of").
