# Restrictions on access [RAD 1.8B16a]
| Fonds 	| Series 	| Files 	| Items 	|
|:-----:	|:------:	|:-----:	|:-----:	|
|   MA    |   MA    |   MA  	|   MA  	|

Use for access restrictions arising from donor, privacy, confidentiality or physical condition requirements.

**Mandatory** at all levels.

## Fonds and series level
At the `fonds` and `series` level, make a narrative note.

To a certain extent, this violates RAD's "non-repetition" rues, which states not to repeat information at lower levels if it has already been provided at a higher level.

The main rationale here is that awareness of restrictions is critical for researchers. It is likely that many will come to a description directly from AtoM search results rather than proceeding from the "general to the specific" from a parent fonds description. Some repetition on this element therefore seems warranted.

Try to minimize the amount of repetition by referring back to the `fonds` description, e.g. when all files are "pending review." But if there are **known** restrictions at the series level, highlight these specifically.


## File and item level
At the `file` and `item` levels, use the following terms:
- `Pending review` = file / item must be reviewed by an archivist for access restrictions prior to release.
- `Open, no restrictions` = no restrictions in the reading room, can be disseminated online.
- `Open, reading room`  = analog material that contains non-sensitive personal information (e.g. addresses older than 5 years) that can be accessed in the reading room, but should not be disseminated online.
- `Open, offline` = same as `Open, reading room` but for digital materials.
- `Open with enclosures` = file contains some restricted documents (typically 3 or less) that have been removed (enclosed), the rest of the file is open.
- `Open with redactions` = digital materials that have been redacted in the access copy.
- `Restricted` = file / item can only be accessed via research agreement.
- `Closed` = file / item can only be accessed by SFU staff for an SFU business purpose (typically because it contains legal advice).

Narrative notes on restrictions should be avoided at this level: text will not display attractively in file or item lists in reports and finding aids.

## Informal access reviews
Reviews of `pending review` files and items should be documented in the general [Rights](rights.md) field.

## Template text / examples

`The records of DEPARTMENT_NAME are university records subject to British Columbia's Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA), and access restrictions may apply to records containing personal information or confidential information (e.g. legal advice). Files marked "pending review" must be reviewed by an archivist prior to release. See the file lists and consult the reference archivist for more information.`

`Series with known restrictions include XXX.`

`The bulk of the files are open with no restrictions. There are XXX main exceptions. DESCRIBE_EXCEPTIONS`

`Access restrictions may apply. See the file / item list and the note on restrictions at the fonds level for more detail.`
