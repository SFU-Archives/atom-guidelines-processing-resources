Use for information relating to copyright in the materials under description.

**Required** at the `fonds` and `series` level.

Only include at the `file` and `item` levels if you are aiming at a **full** description.
- The Archives does not typically include it at these lower levels (partial description).

For assistance in determining copyright term, see the [Canadian Copyright Term and Public Domain Flowchart](https://www.ualberta.ca/faculty-and-staff/copyright/intro-to-copyright-law/licensed-royalty-free-content/pd-flowchart---types.html) created and maintained by the [University of Alberta Copyright Office](https://www.ualberta.ca/faculty-and-staff/copyright/index.html).

The Archives has created static pages in SFU AtoM for information about our practices with respect to [CC Licenses](https://cottonwood.archives.sfu.ca/cc-by-nc) (for SFU and some privately donated records) and for dealing with [mixed copyright ownership](https://cottonwood.archives.sfu.ca/mixed-copyright-ownership) scenarios.
- Where appropriate, link to these pages in the note field at series levels to avoid lengthy repetition of the same information across multiple levels of description.
