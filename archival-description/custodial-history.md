# Custodial history [RAD 1.7C]
| Fonds 	| Series 	| Files 	| Items 	|
|:-----:	|:------:	|:-----:	|:-----:	|
|   MA    |   RE    |   OP  	|   OP  	|

Include any information relating to past custody as well as transfer of the records to Archives.
- This replaces past practice of using the [Immediate source of acquisition](immediate-source-of-acquisition.md) note for cases where custody of records passed directly from creator to Archives.

For digital records, use this element to discuss issues relating to data migrations, conversions, transformations, corruption prior to or during transfer.

**Example:**

`The records were in the custody and control of the creator prior to their transfer to Archives in YYYY.`
