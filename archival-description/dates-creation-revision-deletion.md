Not a RAD element.

Use to communicate changes to the description over time.

**Required** at the **fonds** and all **series** levels.
- Give the month and year plus summary of the revision.
- Include processing archivist's name if you want (optional).
- Use format: `MMM YYYY: summary (Archivist)`.
- Give each entry on a separate line.
- Only document substantive changes, e.g. new accrual processed, series added or revised.
- Do not update for changes to the [Access status](restrictions-on-access.md) of files or items resulting from informal access reviews.

**Optional** but generally not recommended at the **file** and **item** levels.

After internal discussion (fall 2022), most SFU archivists do not typically want to include the archivist's name in the AtoM record.
- But it is up to the individual.
- E.g. students doing descriptive work for the Archives may wish to include their name.
- Revisions at the **fonds** level should be documented in the AIS Fonds record (including name of archivist responsible).

Note that older fonds descriptions will often have data in this field, but not formatted as recommended.
- When revising a description (e.g. processing an accrual), restructure this legacy data.

When commenting (e.g. in a **fonds** record) on other descriptions (e.g. series revised), use markdown to link to the descriptions mentioned.

**Template text / examples:**

`January 2022: Fonds first arranged and described (Matthew Lively).`

`March 2022: Accruals processed, new material added to series 2, 3, and 7 (descriptions revised); new series 10 established and described.`

`September 2022: Series first established and described.`
