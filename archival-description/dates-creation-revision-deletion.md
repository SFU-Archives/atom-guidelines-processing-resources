Not a RAD element.

Use to communicate changes to the description over time.

**Required** at the **fonds** level.
- Give the month and year, summary of the revision, and the name of archivist responsible.
- Use format: `MMM YYYY: summary (Archivist)`.
- Give each entry on a separate line.
- Only document substantive changes, e.g. new accrual processed, series added or revised.
- Do not update for changes to the [Access status](restrictions-on-access.md) of files or items resulting from informal access reviews.

Use at the **series** level if applicable, e.g. when a specific series has been revised or an accrual added to it. **Optional** but generally not recommended at lower levels.

Note that older fonds descriptions will often have data in this field, but not formated as recommended.
- When revising a description (e.g. processing an accrual), restructure this legacy data.

**Template text / examples:**

`January 2022: Fonds first arranged and described (Matthew Lively)`

`March 2014: Accruals processed, added to series 2, 3, and 7 (Richard Dancy).`
