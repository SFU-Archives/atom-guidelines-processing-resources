# Rights area
| Fonds 	| Series 	| Files 	| Items 	|
|:-----:	|:------:	|:-----:	|:-----:	|
|   OP    |   OP    |   IA  	|   IA  	|

The Archives uses this area at the `file` and `item` levels for **one use case only**:
- The descriptions have associated `Digital objects` uploaded to AtoM.
- Copyright belongs to third parties (not SFU); in many cases materials will be orphan works (copyright owner unknown or unlocatable).
- The Archives deems the materials `low risk` and will disseminate them online without first seeking the owner's permission.

Where this scenario applies to `files` or `items`, one `Rights statement` is **required**. AtoM `Rights statements` are actionable: certain settings entered in the `Rights area` will cause a pop-up `Copyright notice` to appear which users must click through (agree to certain conditions) in order to access the full digital object. This section describes how to enter those settings.

It is **optional** to create `Rights statements` at parent `fonds` or `series` levels in order to use AtoM inheritance rules to apply the same statement to all child `files` or `items`.
- This saves repetitive manual data entry.
- Do not use `Rights statements` at aggregate levels for any other purposes.

The `Rights area` can also be used for other purposes but currently this is the only use by SFU Archives. For previous practice (ca. 2016-2021), see the [Background and legacy data](#background-and-legacy-data) section below.




## Background and legacy data
The AtoM `Rights area` provides a set of fields drawn from the [PREMIS Data Dictionary for Preservation Metadata](https://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/). SFU Archives was one of the original sponsors on work to develop this feature in AtoM.
