# Physical description area [RAD 1.5
| Fonds 	| Series 	| Files 	| Items 	|
|:-----:	|:------:	|:-----:	|:-----:	|
|   MA    |   MA    |   OP  	|   OP  	|

Enter each **physical description** (PD) statement on a separate line (no punctuation between lines).

PD is mandatory at **fonds** and **series** level, optional at **file** and **item** levels.

Use as separate PD statement for each **Specific Material Designation** (SMD).
- There is currently no controlled list for SMD terms.

RAD "rule of 3" (1.5B2) is optional.
- If there are more than three SMDs, use one "and other material".
- If using, give detail in a [Physical description note](physical-description-note.md)

Within each PD statement use RAD punctuation to separate elements:
- `extent of descriptive unit: other physical details; dimensions + accompanying material`

**Textual records:**
- Express extent as total shelf space
- E.g. `4.2 m of textual records`

**Non-textual records:**
- Express extents as count of items
- E.g. `ca 500 photographs`

Where there is a significant difference between the intellectual item and its physical carriers, it's better to use the intellectual item as the unit for counting and give the carrier count in brackets.
- E.g. `10 moving images (43 film reels)`

For hybrid fonds (includes analog and digital materials), give separate PD statements for `Paper and analog originals`, `Born-digital materials`, and `Digitized copies`. E.g.

```
Paper and analog originals:
1.25 m of textual records and other materials

Born-digital materials:
6.14 GB of textual records and other materials

Digitized copies:
3 moving images and 1 sound recording (85.55 GB)
```

For calculating series textual extents, see the online [Extent calculator](https://sfuarchives.shinyapps.io/extent_calculator/) and [instructions / documentation](../resources/extent-calculator.md).
