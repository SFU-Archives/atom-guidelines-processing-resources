**Required** at the `fonds` and `series` levels, where the Archives typically aims at `full descriptions`.
- At the `file` and `items` levels, we do not typically provide full description; but if providing, use this field.

Enter each `Physical description` (PD) statement on a separate line (no punctuation between lines).

Use as separate PD statement for each `Specific Material Designation` (SMD).
- For a controlled list of SMDs, see the Archives' [Taxonommies page](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/taxonomies/blob/main/README.md) or download the [Carrier types taxonomy (pdf)](https://github.com/SFU-Archives/taxonomies/blob/main/downloads/carrier-types.pdf).

The RAD "rule of 3" (1.5B2) is optional.
- If there are more than three SMDs, use one "and other material".
- If using, give detail in a [Physical description note](other-notes.md#physical-description-rad-18B9)

Within each PD statement use RAD punctuation to separate elements:
- `extent of descriptive unit: other physical details; dimensions + accompanying material`

**Textual records:**
- Express extent as total shelf space
- E.g. `4.2 m of textual records`

**Non-textual records:**
- Express extents as count of items
- E.g. `ca 500 photographs`
- Where there is a significant difference between the intellectual item and its physical carriers, it's better to use the intellectual item as the unit for counting and give the carrier count in brackets.
- E.g. `10 moving images (43 film reels)`

**Digital materials:**
- Give the total size in the appropriate unit (MB, GB etc), add count of units in brackets if appropriate and give lists of the main file formats as `other physical details`.
- E.g. `10.6 GB of textual records (ca. 3500 news releases): pdf`
- Total size should be calculated from the AIP and DIP.
- Use the [Physical description note](other-notes.md#physical-description-rad-18B9) to indicate that total size includes originals, preservation and access copies.

**For hybrid fonds / series**
If the unit includes analog and digital materials, give separate PD statements for `Paper and analog originals`, `Born-digital materials`, and `Digitized copies`. E.g.

```
Paper and analog originals:
1.25 m of textual records and other materials

Born-digital materials:
6.14 GB of textual records and other materials

Digitized copies:
3 moving images (85.55 GB): mov, mp4
```

**Digitized copies:**
- Give the count of items with digital size in brackets and file formats (preservation and access)
- E.g. `3 moving images (85.55 GB): mov, mp4`

For calculating series textual extents, see the online [Extent calculator](https://sfuarchives.shinyapps.io/extent_calculator/) and [instructions / documentation](../resources/extent-calculator.md).
