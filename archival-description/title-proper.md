A **title** is **mandatory** at all levels of descriptions.

**Fonds:**
- `CreatorName` + "fonds"
- Use the name of the creator at the time of the latest records transferred (even if it is not the current name).
- You do no need to include "Simon Fraser University" in department names.
- But note that some units do incorporate "SFU" as part of their official name, e.g. `SFU International`.
- Example: `Department of Geography fonds`

**Collection:**
- `CollectorName` + subject and / or type of records + "collection"
- Past practice put `CollectorName` in brackets at the end of the title, e.g. `Woman's labour history collection (Sara Diamond collector)`, but this is discontinued (we will eventually convert old titles to new format).
- Example: `Barbara Bates SFU Childcare Society interview collection`

**Series:**
- Always includes the `nature of the archival unit` in the title, e.g. "correspondence", "minutes".
- Use the generic "records" or "files" if nothing more specific applies.
- Series title should never be simply a noun, e.g. "Departmental Tenure Committee" (add e.g. "files" at the end).
- Note that past practice has not always been consistent in this regard.
- Example: `Academic Planning Committee files`

**Files:**
- Transcribe title from file folders where possible.
- When supplying a title (i.e. not transcribing), **do not use square brackets** – explain basis of the title in a [Source of title proper](title-notes.md#source-of-title-proper) note.

**Items:**
- Transcribe title from item where possible (e.g. title page, cassette label).
- Again, do not use square brackets for supplied titles.
