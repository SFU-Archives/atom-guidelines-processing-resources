# Title notes
At least one `Title note` is required at the `fonds` and `series` levels for [Source of title proper](#source-of-title-proper-rad-18b1). Use [Variations in title](#variations-in-title-rad-18b1) for units that have or have been known by more than one name. Use [Parallel titles](#parallel-titles-and-other-information-rad-18b3) only for multi-lingual items that had official titles in multiple languages.

## Attribution and conjectures [RAD 1.8B6]

| Fonds 	| Series 	| Files 	| Items 	|
|:-----:	|:------:	|:-----:	|:-----:	|
|   DN    |   DN    |   DN  	|   DN  	|

Do not use this type.

## Continuation of title [RAD 1.8B4]

| Fonds 	| Series 	| Files 	| Items 	|
|:-----:	|:------:	|:-----:	|:-----:	|
|   NA    |   NA    |   NA  	|   DN  	|

Do not use this type.

## Parallel titles and other information [RAD 1.8B3]

| Fonds 	| Series 	| Files 	| Items 	|
|:-----:	|:------:	|:-----:	|:-----:	|
|   NA    |   NA    |   NA  	|   IA  	|

Use at the `item` level if applicable, typically for publications or grey literature (e.g. reports) that are produced in multi-lingual versions and have different titles in the different languages (e.g. a report issued in both French and English).

## Source of title proper [RAD 1.8B2]

| Fonds 	| Series 	| Files 	| Items 	|
|:-----:	|:------:	|:-----:	|:-----:	|
|   RE    |   RE    |   RE  	|   RE  	|

Use at the `fonds` and `series` levels to indicate the basis of the title.
- Typically base the [Title](title-proper.md) on the content of the unit or on the creator's original title.
- Creator's titles are rare above the `file` and `item` levels.

Can be used at the `file` and `item` levels if you are aiming at a `full description` (but not expected / typically these lower levels).

**Template text / examples:**

`Fonds title based on the name of the creator at the date of the lastest records transferred.1`

`Title supplied by the archivist based on the series content.`

## Statements of responsibility [RAD 1.8B5]

| Fonds 	| Series 	| Files 	| Items 	|
|:-----:	|:------:	|:-----:	|:-----:	|
|   DN    |   DN    |   DN  	|   DN  	|

Not used by SFU Archives.

## Variations in title [RAD 1.8B1]

| Fonds 	| Series 	| Files 	| Items 	|
|:-----:	|:------:	|:-----:	|:-----:	|
|   IA    |   IA    |   IA  	|   IA  	|

Possible use cases include:
- Archives previously used different titles for the unit (include effective dates).
- Creator's original title is problematic and Archives used a supplied title instead (e.g. original title too abbreviated or required anonymization).
- Creator had multiple names for the unit.

If changing the creator's file or item title, give the original title in this note.

**Examples:**

`Creator's original title was "TITLE"; changed by the archivist in YYYY because <<reason>>.`

`The fonds was previously known as XXXX (YYYY-YYYY). Title was revised in YYYY to reflect a change in the name of the department.`
