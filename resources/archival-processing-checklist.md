# Archival Processing Checklist
Use this checklist to help manage arrangement and description projects ([also available as a pdf](../downloads/archival-processing-checklist.pdf)).

- [ ] Revising an existing fonds description: download the pdf finding aid and upload to AIS `Fonds` record (if not already uploaded).

- [ ] Create an AIS `Agent` authority record for creator (if required).

- [ ] Create an AIS `Fonds` record (if required).

- [ ] Create a new AIS `Processing Project` record.

- [ ] University records: download and complete the [Administrative History Data template (Word)](../downloads/admin-history-data-template.docx).

- [ ] Register removal of processed `URC boxes` in the AIS (link boxes to the `Processing Project`).

- [ ] Download and complete a [file / item list template](../downloads/atom-importer-standard.xlsx); if customizing, download and complete [AtoM field mapping template](../downloads/atom-importer-mapping.csv).

- [ ] From the AIS `Processing Project` create new `Container`, `Object`, and `AIP` records as needed for rehoused / processed materials.

- [ ] Manually create the `Fonds` record in SFU AtoM (if required).

- [ ] Transform the Excel file / item list to AtoM csv via the [Online AtoM Import app](online-atom-import-app.md).

- [ ] Import AtoM csv file to AtoM: **first series, then files, then items**.

- [ ] Assign `Containers` to `Locations` in AIS.

- [ ] Print and apply file labels (Excel2AtoM app or download AtoM file list report and import to AIS)

- [ ] Use the online [Extent Calculator](https://sfuarchives.shinyapps.io/extent_calculator/) to get fonds and series extents ([instructions for use here](resources/extent-calculator.md)).

- [ ] Complete full series descriptions in SFU AtoM (see [description templates for boilerplate text](description-template.md).

- [ ] If you have [finding aid appendices](finding-aid-appendices.md), describe them in the AtoM `Finding aids` note field.

- [ ] In AtoM, update `Publication status` (= "published") of the new descriptions; check `Update descendants` in the fonds record to set for the entire fonds.

- [ ] Generate the pdf finding aid in AtoM; if including appendices, merge with pdf, delete AtoM pdf and upload pdf with appendices.

- [ ] In AIS, mark the `Processing Project` record completed.

- [ ] Remove the printed `Accession forms` from the `Unprocessed Holdings binder` in the reading room.

- [ ] In the AIS, complete and print the `Processing Report` for the collection file and updated container and backlog location lists.
