The [Resolution Calculator](https://sfuarchives.shinyapps.io/resolution_calculator/) is an online app created in `R` by Kelsey Poloney, hosted on the Archives' `shinyapps` site.
- For code documentation, see the [developer's Github page](https://github.com/kpoloney/resolution_calculator).

For digitization of photographic materials (negatives, slides, prints), the Archives uses a formula to determine the resolution that will result in an image with 4000 pixels on its longest side. The [Resolution Calculator](https://sfuarchives.shinyapps.io/resolution_calculator/) provides an interface to simplify the calculation.
- Enter the length of the longest side of the item.
- Select the unit of measurement (cm, inches etc).
- Enter the target number of pixel for the longest side of the image.
- Click the `Calculate` button to get the resolution.

You can use the Calculator to determine scanning resolutions for any sized object with any desired target pixels, but the Archives typically use a standard, fixed resolution for textual records and larger graphic materials.
- 600 dpi for textual records scanned to pdf.
- xxx dpi for larger graphic materials (posters, maps) digitized with the poster scanner.
