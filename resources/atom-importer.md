# AtoM Importer
###### Last updated: Apr 12, 2023
The Archives typically requires only minimal description at the **file** and **item** levels â€“ simple lists giving only `Reference code`, `Title`, `Dates`, `Access status`, and `Container number`. It is time-consuming to enter these lists manually in AtoM, record-by-record. As an alternative, you can use either the standard AtoM csv import template or SFU Archives' own custom import templates.

## Standard AtoM import template
The AtoM import template is a csv file with columns for each AtoM field (there are about 80 columns). Once completed, it can be uploaded directly to AtoM.
1. Download [the AtoM csv import template](https://wiki.accesstomemory.org/wiki/Resources/CSV_templates) from the AtoM documentation site.
2. Delete any columns not required.
3. Enter data, save the csv file.
4. Open the SFU AtoM production site, log in, and navigate to `Import` > `CSV`.
5. On the `Import CSV` page, use the following settings (these are the defaults, they do not need to be changed):
    - `Type` = "Archival description"
    - `Update behaviours` = "Ignore matches and create new records on import"
    - `Skip matched records` = UNCHECKED
    - `Do not index records` = UNCHECKED
    - Use the `Select file` button to navigate to / select the csv file you created in step 6.

AtoM will import the data and create new description records linked to their existing parent AtoM records.

See AtoM documentation for more information on this process.

## SFU Archives custom import templates
The Archives has its own custom import templates. These differ from the standard AtoM template in that they are in Excel rather than csv format. They allow you to:
- Use calculation fields in the template (e.g. for reference codes).
- Use controlled vocabularies to ensure consistent data entry (drop-down menus).
- Easily set default values for specific fields.

The main drawback is that the import process is more complicated with the SFU templates. With these you must:
- Complete both a data-entry template and an AtoM field-mapping document and save both as csv.
- Use the online [AtoM Import Converter app](https://sfuarchives.shinyapps.io/atom_import/) to transform the Archives' template into the standard AtoM csv template for upload to AtoM.

### Complete the data-entry template
Download the Excel [Data entry template](../downloads/atom-importer-data-entry.xlsx).
- It includes separate tabs for listing series, files, and items, as well as a tab for taxonomies (controlled terms used on the other data in the form of drop-down menus).

**It is critical that all descriptions listed on your import template ALREADY have parent records in AtoM.**
- Make sure the **fonds** and all **series**, **sub-series**, and **sub-sub-series** already exist in AtoM before importing **files**.
- Import all **files** before you import **items**.
- Only with the **series** tab can you include both parent and child series on the same spreadsheet.

See below ([Data entry guidance](#data-entry-guidance)) for more detail on completing the template.

When data entry is complete, save the tab as a csv file.

### Save the field-mapping document
Download the Excel [Field mapping document](../downloads/atom-importer-field-mapping.xlsx). This maps the columns in your data entry csv file to the corresponding AtoM field.
- It also includes separate tabs for series, files, and items.

See below ([Field mapping guidance](#field-mapping-guidance) for more about editing AtoM field mapppings.

Save the appropriate tab as a csv file, e.g. use the `Files` for a file list, `Items` for an item list, etc.

### Adjust formatting
When saving the both Excel files as csv with a Mac, `character encoding` and `line endings` settings will need to be adjusted.
- Open the csv file in BBEdit and change these to `Unicode (UTF-8)` and `Unix (LF)` respectively.

### Use the online AtoM Import Converter app
The [AtoM Import Converter app](https://sfuarchives.shinyapps.io/atom_import/) is a web application, written in `R` by Kelsey Poloney and hosted on the Archives' `shinyapps` site. It takes the two csv files (data-entry and field-mapping) to create a standard AtoM csv import file ready for upload to AtoM.

Under `Institution` select "Other".

Under `Upload descriptions (csv)`, click the `Browse` button and navigate to / select your `data-entry.csv` file.

Under `Upload mapping (csv)`, click the `Browse` button and navigate to / select you `field-mapping.csv` file.

The app will create a new csv file called `atom_import.csv` and save it to your `Downloads` folder.
- This file is ready for upload to AtoM following the same steps above described under [AtoM import template](#atom-import-template).

Note that in earlier versions of the app, you could specify the institution (either SFU Archives or SFU Special Collections) and upload an institution-specific template, omitting the need to upload the `field-mapping` file.
- This is no longer supported; you must ALWAYS select "Other" as the `Institution` and upload a `field-mapping` file.

## Customize the Archives' templates
You can further customize the templates in a number of ways:
- Add new columns for entering data in additional AtoM fields.
- Edit existing taxonomies or add new ones on the `Taxonomies` tab.
- Add / edit default values on the `field-mapping` file.

If you add new columns to the `data entry` file, you need to update the `field-mapping` file by indicating which AtoM field the new columns map to.

If you do not need a column one a specific template, you can simply delete it; you do not need to make any changes to the `field-mapping` file.

## From Excel to AtoM
<img align="right" width="400" src="../screenshots/atom-importer-standard.png">

1. Download and complete the [SFU Archives standard AtoM Importer data entry template (Excel)](../downloads/atom-importer-standard.xlsx).
2. Save the file as `csv`.
3. Open the online app in any web browser at https://sfuarchives.shinyapps.io/atom_import/.
4. Under `Institution` select "SFU Archives" (or "SFU Special Collections").
5. Under `Upload Description` click the `Browse` button and navigate to / select the csv file you saved in step 2.
6. When upload is complete, a `Download` button appears; click to create and download the data as a `AtoM csv import file`.
7. Open the SFU AtoM production site, log in, and navigate to `Import` > `CSV`.
8. On the `Import CSV` page, use the following settings (these are the defaults, they do not need to be changed):
    - `Type` = "Archival description"
    - `Update behaviours` = "Ignore matches and create new records on import"
    - `Skip matched records` = UNCHECKED
    - `Do not index records` = UNCHECKED
    - Use the `Select file` button to navigate to / select the csv file you created in step 6.

AtoM will import the data and create new description records linked to their existing parent AtoM records.

## Notes on usage
**It is critical that all descriptions listed on your import template ALREADY have parent records in AtoM.**
- Make sure the `fonds` and all `series`, `sub-series`, and `sub-sub-series` already exist in AtoM before importing `files`.
- Import all `files` before you import `items`.
- You cannot for example include both `files` and their child `items` on the same import `csv` file (as you can with the standard `AtoM csv import file`).

The Excel template is mainly intended for listing `files` and `items` but can be used for `series`.
- Alternatively, use a [custom template](#custom-templates) specifically designed for `series`.

When saving the Excel file as csv with a Mac, `character encoding` and `line endings` settings may need to be adjusted.
- Open the csv file in BBEdit and change these to `Unicode (UTF-8)` and `Unix (LF)`.

## Guide to SFU Archives' standard template
<img align="right" width="400" src="../screenshots/atom-importer-template.png">

[Download the Archives' standard Excel template here.](../downloads/atom-importer-standard.xlxs). The template is an Excel document with 2 tabs. The `FilesItems` tab is for data entry. The `Taxonomies` tab contains the set of controlled terms that generate the drop-down lists on the `FilesItems` tab; terms can be edited here.

**Important:**
- Do not delete or edit the greyed-out `Ref code` column (G) on the `FilesItems` tab: it is a calculation field that generates the unit's full reference code, required for AtoM import

- Do not enter data below the greyed-out line in row 100: add new rows above as needed; delete this line when you have finished data entry and save the document as `csv`.

`Fonds`, `Series`, `Sub[series]`, `SubSub[series]` columns (A-D)
- Enter the reference number.
- Enter `0` if not applicable; **do not leave blank**.

`File`, `Item` columns (E-F)
- Enter the reference number.
- `Item` can be left blank if not applicable.

`Ref code` (G)
- Calculation field that returns the unit's full reference code.
- **Do not edit or delete.**

`Title` (H)
- Enter `file` / `item` title.
- Do not use square bracket for supplied titles; you can add a title note in column O if desired.

`Date range` (I)
- Enter date range as text, e.g. "2009-2012".
- If there is no range, just enter the year, e.g. "2010".
- This is the value that will appear to the public in AtoM; use any qualifiers as needed, e.g. "ca."

`Start` / `End` (J-K)
- Enter a 4-digit number for the start and end year, even if it is the same as `Date range`.
- **Do not leave blank, do not enter any qualifiers or other text.**
- This is the value that AtoM uses behind the scenes for sorting and searching.

`Access status` (L)
- Select a value from the drop-down list.
- List terms can be edited on the `Taxonomies` tab.

`Container` (M)
- Enter the container number, e.g. "1", "15".
- **Do not include the fonds prefix (e.g. "260-1"); the hyphen can cause Excel to interpret and reformat the date as a date.**
- You can also enter `Object ID` or `Box ID` numbers here if appropriate (e.g. "OBJ-40888", "BOX-76445").
- For `files` that are stored directly to shelf (no `container`), enter "Shelf".

`Container type` (N)
- Select a value from the drop-down list (terms can be edited on the `Taxonomies` tab).

`Source of title` (O)
- Enter a RAD `Title note` if desired.
- Can be left blank.

`Note` (P)
- Any notes for your own reference, e.g. to help when writing `series` descriptions.
- **This data will not be imported into AtoM.**

When you have completed data entry, delete the last greyed-out line and save the file as `csv`.

## Custom templates
<img align="right" width="400" src="../screenshots/atom-importer-custom.png">

The standard template covers the typical `file` or `item` list SFU Archives requires. But for special cases that use other fields, you can create custom templates.

Possible use cases:
- In-house digitization projects.
- Metadata supplied by vendors in outsourced digitization work.
- Descriptive data stored in legacy systems.
- Retroactive addition of data or revision to existing AtoM descriptions.

<br clear="both">

**How to use:**
<img align="right" width="400" src="../screenshots/atom-importer-mapping.png">

1. Create and complete your custom template.
2. Save as `csv`.
3. Complete the [AtoM Importer Mapping Template](../downloads/atom-importer-mapping.csv) to map the columns of the custom template to the AtoM fields.
    - The AtoM fields are all listed in column A.
    - Enter the name of your template's column against the appropriate AtoM field.
    - Use `[=xxxxx]` to set default data (will be entered in all rows).
4. Open the [online AtoM Importer app](https://sfuarchives.shinyapps.io/atom_import/).
5. Under `Institution` select "Other".
6. Under `Upload Description` select the csv file you saved in step 2.
7. Under `Upload Mapping` select the csv mapping document you created in step 3.
8. When upload is complete, a `Download` button appears; click to create and download the data as a `AtoM csv import file`.
