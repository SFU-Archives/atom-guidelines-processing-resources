# SFU AtoM Guidelines and Processing Resources
This site provides guidelines for the use of [SFU AtoM](https://atom.archives.sfu.ca) and information about other resources that support archival arrangement and description more generally.

[Access-to-Memory (AtoM)](https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/) is an open-source application for archival description and access. [SFU Archives](https://www.sfu.ca/archives.html) and the [Special Collections and Rare Books](https://www.lib.sfu.ca/about/branches-depts/special-collections) division of [SFU Library](https://www.lib.sfu.ca) maintain a shared AtoM site ([SFU AtoM](https://atom.archives.sfu.ca)), providing a single platform for public access to archival holdings at the university.

 SFU Archives and SFU Special Collections are separate institutions. As joint users of a shared resource, we try to align our practices to ensure consistency throughout SFU AtoM. But practices may sometimes diverge, and some documentation may pertain more to one unit than the other.

 This site is a work-in-progress and a number of pages / links are still in preparation.

### AtoM data entry guidelines
- [Archival descriptions](archival-description/overview.md)
- Authority records (in progress)
- [Description template and boilerplate text (text file)](downloads/description-template.txt)
- Note that neither Archives nor Special Collections currently use the AtoM **Accessions module**.

### Import file / item lists
- [AtoM csv import templates (link)](https://wiki.accesstomemory.org/wiki/Resources/CSV_templates)
- [Apps for converting Excel file lists to AtoM csv templates](resources/file-item-lists.md)
    - Online AtoM Import app (web-based app written in R)
    - Excel2AtoM FileMaker utility (standalone FileMaker app)

### Other resources for arrangement and description
- [Archival Processing Checklist (SFU Archives)](resources/archival-processing-checklist.md)
- [Extent Calculator – description page](resources/extent-calculator.md) | [Link – online app](https://sfuarchives.shinyapps.io/extent_calculator/)
- [Admin History Data template – description page](resources/admin-history-data-template.md) | [Template – Word doc](downloads/admin-history-data-template.docx) | [Example – pdf](downloads/admin-history-data-example.pdf)
- [Finding aid appendices – description page](resources/finding-aid-appendices.md) | [Template – Word doc](downloads/finding-aid-appdenices.docx)

### AIS database documentation
The Archives' AIS (Archives Information System) is a custom FileMaker database to support the department's programs and functions. User and technical documentation is maintained on the department's internal wiki, accessible only to SFU Archives' staff (links below will only work if you are logged in on the wiki).

The `Processing Projects` table in the `Archives module` supports activities involved in arrangement and description, e.g. removal of processed boxes from the storage system; creation of new containers, objects, and AIPs; creation of standardized statistical and project reports.
