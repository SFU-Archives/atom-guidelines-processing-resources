# SFU AtoM Guidelines and Processing Resources
This site provides guidelines for the use of [SFU AtoM](https://atom.archives.sfu.ca) and information about other resources that support archival arrangement and description more generally.

[Access-to-Memory (AtoM)](https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/) is an open-source application for archival description and access. [SFU Archives](https://www.sfu.ca/archives.html) and the [Special Collections and Rare Books](https://www.lib.sfu.ca/about/branches-depts/special-collections) division of [SFU Library](https://www.lib.sfu.ca) maintain a shared AtoM site ([SFU AtoM](https://atom.archives.sfu.ca)), providing a single platform for public access to archival holdings at the university.

 SFU Archives and SFU Special Collections are separate institutions. As joint users of a shared resource, we try to broadly align our practices to ensure consistency throughout SFU AtoM. Most of the documentation on this site, however, was created by Archives; Special Collections' practices may sometimes diverge.

 This site is a work-in-progress and pages / links will be added as they are prepared.
