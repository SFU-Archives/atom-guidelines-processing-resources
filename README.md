# SFU AtoM Guidelines and Processing Resources
This site provides guidelines for the use of [SFU AtoM](https://atom.archives.sfu.ca), as well as information about other resources that support archival arrangement and description more generally.

[Access-to-Memory (AtoM)](https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/) is an open-source application for archival description and access. [SFU Archives](https://www.sfu.ca/archives.html) and the [Special Collections and Rare Books](https://www.lib.sfu.ca/about/branches-depts/special-collections) division of [SFU Library](https://www.lib.sfu.ca) maintain a shared AtoM site ([SFU AtoM](https://atom.archives.sfu.ca)), providing a single platform for public access to archival holdings at the university.

 SFU Archives and SFU Special Collections are separate institutions. As joint users of a shared resource, we try to align our practices to ensure consistency throughout SFU AtoM. But practices may sometimes diverge, and some documentation may pertain more to one unit than the other.

### AtoM data entry guidelines
[Archival descriptions](archival-description/overview.md): field-by-field guidelines for data entry in AtoM archival descriptions.

[Authority records](authority-records/overview.md): field-by-field guidelines for data entry in AtoM authority records.

[Description template and boilerplate text (text file)](downloads/description-template.txt): guidance and commonly used wording for for fields typically used in **fonds** and **series** descriptions.

Note that neither Archives nor Special Collections currently use the AtoM **Accessions module**.

### Other resources for arrangement and description
[Archival Processing Checklist](resources/archival-processing-checklist.md): steps involved in a processing project (SFU Archives).

[AtoM csv import templates](https://wiki.accesstomemory.org/wiki/Resources/CSV_templates): link to AtoM documentation for download of latest import templates.

[File / item list utilities](resources/file-item-lists.md): apps for converting custom file lists to AtoM csv templates ready for upload to AtoM.

- [Online AtoM Import app](resrouces/online-atom-import-app.md): web-based app written in R.

- [Excel2AtoM FileMaker utility](resources/atom2excel-utility.md): standalone FileMaker app, similar to above, but with some additional functionality (e.g. print file folder labels).

[Extent Calculator](resources/extent-calculator.md): online app for calculating fonds and series extents based on box types.

[Admin History Data template](downloads/admin-history-data-template.zip): Word document for presenting departmental administrative history data in visual, table format (name changes, reporting relationships, chief officers).

### AIS database documentation
The Archives' AIS (Archives Information System) is a custom FileMaker database to support the department's programs and functions. User and technical documentation is maintained on the department's internal wiki, accessible only to SFU Archives' staff (links below will only work if you are logged in on the wiki). The **Processing Projects** table in the **Archives** module supports activities involved in arrangement and description (removal of processed boxes from the storage system; creation of new containers, objects, and AIPs; creation of standardized statistical and project reports).
