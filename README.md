# SFU AtoM and Archival Processing Guidelines
[SFU AtoM](https://atom.archives.sfu.ca) is a web-based application for archival description and access, running on the open-source software [Access-to-Memory (AtoM)](https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/). It is shared by [SFU Archives](https://www.sfu.ca/archives.html) and the [Special Collections and Rare Books](https://www.lib.sfu.ca/about/branches-depts/special-collections) division of [SFU Library](https://www.lib.sfu.ca), providing a single public platform for access to archival holdings at the university.

 This site provides documentation for the use of AtoM at SFU. It includes data-entry guidelines, information to support site administration (e.g. management of user accounts and static pages), as well as other resources relating to archival arrangement and description in general (e.g. extent calculator, print file labels).

 SFU Archives and SFU Special Collections are separate institutions. As joint users of a shared resource, we try to align our practices to ensure consistency throughout SFU AtoM. But practices may sometimes diverge, and some documentation may pertain more to one unit than the other.

### Data entry guidelines
- [Archival descriptions](archival-description/overview.md): field-by-field guidelines for AtoM archival descriptions.

- [Authority records](authority-records/overview.md): field-by-field guidelines for AtoM authority records.

- [Description template and boilerplate text](resources/description-template.md): commonly used wording for for fonds- and series-level descriptions.

- Note that neither Archives nor Special Collections currently use the AtoM **Accessions module**.

### System administration
- Static pages
- Production / public site sync
- User accounts

### Processing resources
- [Archival Processing Checklist](resources/archival-processing-checklist.md): steps involved in a processing project.

- [AtoM Import utility](resrouces/atom-import-utility.md): web-based app for converting custom file lists to AtoM csv template ready for upload to AtoM.

- [Excel2AtoM utility](utilities/atom2excel-utility.md): standalone FileMaker app, similar to above, but with some additional functionality (e.g. print file folder labels).

- [AtoM csv import templates](https://wiki.accesstomemory.org/wiki/Resources/CSV_templates): link to AtoM download site for latest import templates.

- [Extent Calculator](resources/extent-calculator.md): online app for calculating fonds and series extents based on box types.

- [Admin History Data template](downloads/admin-history-data-template.zip): Word document for presenting departmental administrative history data in visual, table format (name changes, reporting relationships, chief officers).

### AIS database documentation
The Archives' AIS (Archives Information System) is a custom FileMaker database with separate modules to support the department's programs and functions. User and technical documentation is maintained on the department's internal wiki, accessible only to SFU Archives' staff (links below will only work if you are logged in on the wiki). The **Processing Projects** table in the **Archives** module supports activities involved in arrangement and description (removal of processed boxes from the storage system; creation of new containers, objects, and AIPs; creation of standardized statistical and project reports).
